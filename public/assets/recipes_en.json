    "steps": [
      "Gather all the ingredients.",
      "Heat a cast iron skillet or regular frying pan over high heat. When the pan is hot, add 0.5 Tbsp neutral oil. Sear the pork belly block fat-side down first, then flip over to sear the other side; this will take about 10 minutes.",
      "While searing, prepare a heavy-bottomed pot (or regular pot) that will fit the chashu. To the pot, add long green onion, 4 slices ginger (unpeeled), 80 ml wine (or mirin substitute), 80 ml soy sauce, 160 ml water, and 45 g sugar.",
      "Once the meat is seared, add it to the pot. Bring the liquid to a boil, skimming the scum and foam. Then, turn the heat to low/simmer.",
      "Put an otoshibuta (drop lid) or aluminium foil on top to press the ingredients down and limit the evaporation. Simmer on low heat for 1 hour, turning the chashu every 15 minutes and keeping the otoshibuta on at all times.",
      "After 1 hour, there should be about ½ inch of liquid left in the pot. Remove the otoshibuta and further reduce the sauce on low heat until it thickens and you can see the bottom of the pot when you draw a line through the sauce with a spatula.",
      "To serve, slice the chashu into ¼-inch (6 mm) pieces. Optionally, sear the slices with a kitchen butane torch to enhance the flavor.",
      "For the eggs, boil and simmer your eggs for 6 minutes.",
      "Prepare ice bath to add your eggs into after they're finished boiling. Leave for 5-10 mins to cool.",
      "In a ziplock bag, combine water or stock, soy sauce, mirin, dark soy sauce (if using), ginger, garlic, and sugar. For ramen eggs made without mirin: Substitute water or stock with a pinch of sugar and a few drops of vinegar.",
      "Peel eggs carefully and add to your sauce.",
      "Once cooled, marinate boiled eggs in the mixture for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight, for the best flavor."
